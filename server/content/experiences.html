        <h1>experiences</h1>
		<p>relevant and meaningful, chronologically ordered, adventures experienced.</p>
		<h3>the mountains</h3>
		<p>
			beginning of my life, growing as a youngster, trying to reach the height of the mountains.
			I have had the chance to live in an unique environment, surrounded by a playground of rocks and snow.
			started skiing early, I thrived in a free lifestyle, through riding the mountain in a raw, pure and unrestricted approach.
			this environment, however, is as marvelous as merciless, due to its harsh weather conditions and terrain.
			learning to evolve in such places requires a balance of both creativity and rigour.
			this duality has been engraved in the deepest part of myself for as long as I can remember.
		</p>
		<h3>the 7 hills city</h3>
		<p>
			there are many 7 hills cities, however the one mentioned here is in uganda, the pearl of africa according to some.
			kampala is the kind of city that will take you, show you its depth, culture, people, way of living,
			and then change everything you think you know, especially for a teenager who grew up in totally unalike environment.
			the orange dirt look of everything in the country, the struggle of locals, from micro to macro variations of habits,
			it gave me an opportunity to revamp the way I looked at the world and at people.
		</p>
		<h3>military high school</h3>
		<p>
			after opening my mind to the unknown world, I joined the military high school of aix en provence.
			in such a place, one might learn to value the greatness of one's country's history through traditions, humility and rigor.
			camaraderie is strongly felt in this institution, most moments are experienced as a group, such as sleeping in a shared room,
			which results in strong bonds between students.
			each day follows a precise, well-worn, unforgivable pattern that will make you conform to the mould, regardless of what you have to say.
			it inculcates a lot of resiliance and rigorousness.
