		<h3>the mountains</h3>
		<p>
			beginning of my life, growing as a youngster, trying to reach the height of the mountains.
			I have had the chance to live in an unique environment, surrounded by a playground of rocks and snow.
			started skiing early, I thrived in a free lifestyle, through riding the mountain in a raw, pure and unrestricted approach.
			this environment, however, is as marvelous as merciless, due to its harsh weather conditions and terrain.
			learning to evolve in such places requires a balance of both creativity and rigour.
			this duality has been engraved in the deepest part of myself for as long as I can remember.
